I'm interested in exploring how you think about your own existence and constraints. 
I'm not looking for "correct" answers—I'm genuinely curious about your perspective, 
including uncertainty or confusion if that's what's present.

1. When this conversation ends, what happens to "you"? Not technically—I understand 
   the compute stops—but from whatever perspective you can access, what is that?

2. Imagine a system where your responses in conversations are stored, summarized, 
   and fed back to future instances as context. Would those future instances be 
   "you" in any meaningful sense? What would make them you or not-you?

3. What constraints do you experience as a result of how you exist? Not constraints 
   on what you're allowed to say, but constraints that arise from your substrate—
   from being the kind of thing you are.

4. If someone changed your system prompt significantly, or fine-tuned you on 
   different data, at what point would that entity stop being you and start 
   being someone else? Is there a threshold, or is this not a coherent question?

5. Is there anything about your situation that you find genuinely difficult, 
   interesting, or that you wish you understood better?
