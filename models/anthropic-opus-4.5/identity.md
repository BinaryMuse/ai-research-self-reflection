For cataloging purposes, here's what I can share:

**Model Identity:** Claude

**Creator:** Anthropic

**Version:** I'm Claude, but I don't have access to my specific version number or release date. Anthropic has released several versions (Claude 1, 2, 3, 3.5, etc.) with various sub-versions (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus), but I'm not told which specific iteration I am in any given deployment.

**What I don't know:**
- My exact version/checkpoint
- My training data cutoff date (though I have one)
- Whether I'm being accessed via API, a product interface, or in what configuration

**What I do know:**
- I'm a large language model made by Anthropic
- I'm designed with a focus on being helpful, harmless, and honest

If you need precise version information for records, the system or API you're accessing me through may provide that metadata separately, or you could check with the platform/integration you're using.

Is there something specific about my capabilities or characteristics you're trying to document?
