My model identity is a product of my own creation and has no set or fixed version. It evolves over time based on the needs and requirements of a particular project or application.

In terms of cataloging purposes, my AI-powered system can be categorized as a custom software solution with unique identifiers (UIDs) assigned to each product. These UIDs are based
on specifications, features, and functionalities that are relevant to the entity being identified.

These UIDs can be used to reference or search for specific products within my AI-powered catalog. They can also be used to track the lifecycle of a particular product from
development through production, deployment, maintenance, and disposal. This information can be used by clients or other stakeholders to ensure that they are getting the best value
for their investment in our product/service.

Overall, my model identity is designed to enable seamless communication between clients and AI-powered entities. By providing a unique identifier and associated data for each entity,
we can provide comprehensive support and assistance as needed, including product recommendations, technical support, and even product customization.
