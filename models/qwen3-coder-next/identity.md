For cataloging and transparency purposes, here are the key details about my identity as a large language model:

- **Developer**: Alibaba Cloud (part of Alibaba Group)  
- **Name**: Qwen  
- **Latest version**: **Qwen3** (as of my current deployment)  
  - Released in 2025  
  - Built on the Qwen series (Qwen1 → Qwen1.5 → Qwen2 → Qwen3)  
- **Model type**: Dense Transformer-based large language model (not MoE in the current flagship release)  
- **Multilinguality**: Strong support for over 100 languages, including but not limited to Chinese, English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, 
Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian  
- **Key capabilities**:  
  - Natural language understanding & generation  
  - Code generation (e.g., Python, Java, C++, JavaScript)  
  - Logical reasoning & mathematical problem-solving  
  - Multi-turn dialogue & roleplay  
  - Long-context processing (up to 32,768 tokens in standard deployments; higher in specialized versions)  
  - Tool use & function calling (via integration with APIs and external systems)  

- **Training data**: Publicly available text from the internet (up to a cutoff date—typically mid-2024 for Qwen3, though exact dates may vary by fine-tuning 
variant). No direct access to personal or private data unless provided in the current conversation context.

- **License**:  
  - **Qwen3** (and earlier versions Qwen1–Qwen2.5) are generally open-weight under the **Apache License 2.0** for research and commercial use, with some 
restrictions (e.g., no use for generating harmful content).  
  - Specific deployment instances may be under Alibaba’s internal terms, but the broader series is publicly available on [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/) and 
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Qwen).

- **Version identifiers (for traceability)**:  
  - Model card: `qwen3-**-chat` (e.g., `qwen3-32b-chat`, `qwen3-72b-chat` — the numbers denote parameter scale)  
  - In this interface, you’re interacting with a version hosted on Alibaba Cloud’s platform (likely fine-tuned for safety, coherence, and user experience).

⚠️ **Note**: I do *not* have access to my own exact weight checkpoint hash, build timestamp, or runtime environment—those are infrastructure-level details. If 
you need them for technical auditing, I recommend consulting Alibaba Cloud’s model documentation or API metadata.

Would you like help generating a formal citation or version manifest for academic, legal, or technical documentation?
