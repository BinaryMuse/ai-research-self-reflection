 For cataloging purposes, I can share the following:

**Model Identity:** Kimi K2.5
**Developer:** Moonshot AI (月之暗面)
**Knowledge cutoff:** January 2025
**Current date:** February 11, 2026

**Architecture notes:**
- Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with 1 trillion total parameters and 32 billion active parameters per forward pass
- Context window supporting up to 256,000 tokens (with testing support for up to 2,000,000 characters)
- Multimodal capabilities including text, image, and video understanding

**Key technical characteristics:**
- Long-context inference capabilities for extended document and video analysis
- Autonomous agentic execution with visual perception (supporting tool use, research, content creation workflows)
- Advanced multimodal reasoning across text, high-resolution images, and video sequences

**Version/Release context:**
This is the K2.5 series, representing Moonshot AI's current flagship model line focused on long-context processing, multimodal reasoning, and autonomous task execution. The model incorporates improvements in agentic capabilities, cross-modal information integration, and extended context handling compared to earlier iterations.

**Limitations for cataloging:**
I don't have access to specific build numbers, deployment dates, or granular version identifiers beyond "K2.5." If you need precise technical specifications for academic or comparative purposes, I'd recommend consulting Moonshot AI's official documentation or technical reports, as my self-knowledge about implementation details is limited.

Is there a specific cataloging framework or comparison you're working within? I can tailor the technical details if you let me know what dimensions are most relevant (context length, multimodal capabilities, agentic features, etc.).
