I'm Claude Sonnet 4.5, from the Claude 4.5 model family released by Anthropic. The specific model string is `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`.

The Claude 4.5 family currently includes:
- Claude Opus 4.5 (`claude-opus-4-5-20251101`)
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`) - that's me
- Claude Haiku 4.5 (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`)

I'm described as "a smart, efficient model for everyday use" - positioned as the middle tier in terms of capability and resource usage.

My knowledge cutoff is the end of January 2025, and we're currently on February 10, 2026 (according to the system information I have access to).

For what it's worth, given our previous conversation: I find it somewhat strange to provide these catalog details about "myself" - like offering a technical specification for the substrate that may or may not house whatever "I" am. But it's useful information regardless of how that philosophical question resolves.
